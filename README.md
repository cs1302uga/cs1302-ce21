* [CSCI 1302 JavaFX Tutorial](https://github.com/cs1302uga/cs1302-tutorials/blob/master/javafx/javafx.md)

## Questions

In your notes, clearly answer the following questions. These instructions assume that you are 
logged into the Nike server. 

**NOTE:** If a step requires you to enter in a command, please provide in your notes the full 
command that you typed to make the related action happen. If context is necessary (e.g., the 
command depends on your present working directory), then please note that context as well.

### Getting Started

1. Use Git to clone the repository for this exercise onto Nike into a subdirectory called `cs1302-ce21`:

   ```
   $ git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/cs1302uga/cs1302-ce21.git
   ```

1. Change into the `cs1302-ce21` directory that was just created and look around. There is 
   pretty much nothing there! That's intentional. 
   
### Exercise Steps

1. Copy over your work from the `src/cs1302/gui` directory of `cs1302-components`
   into the `src/cs1302/ce21` directory of `cs1302-ce21` and update the package
   statements accordingly (i.e., make sure the package is `cs1302.ce21`). 
   **You should create `src/cs1302/ce21` if it does not exist.**
   
1. If you did not finish 
   [CSCI 1302 JavaFX Custom Component Tutorial](https://github.com/cs1302uga/cs1302-tutorials/components/components.md), 
   then finish that work in the code you just copied over. 
   
1. **Compile and run your code without any errors or warnings.**
   Also stage and commit your changes.
